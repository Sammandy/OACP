## Dice Problem
It handles edge cases where the input is less than or equal to 0 by returning 0.
It initializes a dynamic programming array dp of size n+1 to store the number of ways to achieve each sum from 0 to n.
It initializes dp[0] to 1 because there is only one way to achieve a sum of 0 (by not rolling the dice).
It iterates over each possible sum from 1 to n and for each sum, it iterates over each possible outcome of rolling the dice (from 1 to 6).
For each sum i, it calculates the number of ways to achieve i by considering the number of ways to achieve the previous sums that could lead to i when a particular number j is rolled on the dice.
It updates dp[i] by adding the number of ways to achieve i-j.
It applies modulo operation %MOD to ensure the result stays within a certain range, typically to prevent integer overflow.
Finally, it outputs the value of dp[n], which represents the total number of ways to achieve the sum n.
