## Grid Paths
Input is provided as a grid represented by a vector of vectors of characters, where '.' represents a path and '*' represents an obstacle.
Initialize a 2D vector dp to store the number of ways to reach each cell.
Set dp[1][1] to 1 if the starting cell is not an obstacle (i.e., grid[0][0] is '.'), indicating one way to be in the starting position.
Dynamic Programming Computation:

Iterate over the grid using nested loops.
If the current cell grid[i-1][j-1] is an obstacle ('*'), set dp[i][j] to 0.
Otherwise, the number of ways to reach dp[i][j] is the sum of ways to reach the cell above it (dp[i-1][j]) and the cell to the left of it (dp[i][j-1]), modulo MOD to keep the number within limits.
Finally, print dp[n][n], which represents the number of ways to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.
This algorithm efficiently computes the number of ways to reach the destination considering obstacles and should work well for reasonably sized grids. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the size of the grid.
